    <p>You wouldn&rsquo;t think that from glancing at the imdb page, where it has a rating of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>, but watching it again last night, it finally resonated with me.</p>

<p>I think that I watched it with my now, ex-girlfriend about a year and a half ago. I hadn&rsquo;t been paying close attention, and watching a movie with someone else is always a bit distracting for me. And so I came away with it empty handed and just lost.</p>

<p>The description on the movie says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James breaks it off with Katie, but feels bad about it. He doesn&rsquo;t like hurting people. At least he&rsquo;s seeing Monica tonight, she&rsquo;s always fun. He doesn’t connect with her though, not like with Sarah – but they’re just friends. He was close with Natalie too, until she moved to LA. That reminds him, he’s going to work with that actress, Anna something. She’s probably too famous to talk to him though. And besides, Lily should be back soon and he really wants to see her. Sometimes he misses Lorraine, but thinking about her just makes him sad. Whenever he feels lonely, he texts Rapunzel – that’s not her name, he just can’t remember it. He should really delete her from his phone. But he can’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The movie follows a guy who goes through different scenes and encounters with different girls that are in his life. And at the end, after he gets rejected, he goes to the apartment of a girl wearing lingerie and doing coke, who he seemed the most comfortable with, but he ends up running away, like he&rsquo;s made this mistake before. There wasn&rsquo;t really a sense of plot or time in the movie, each seemed separated from the rest, like they are memories.</p>

<p>Who knows what the movie is about, I actually don&rsquo;t want to look up any other critical reviews about this or any other comments about it (I only read one youtube comment, but he was way off imo), so that I can rewatch it over time with people and see what they think.</p>

<p>I would say that this movie follows the life of a guy who is obviously (from the opening scene) afraid of committment and hasn&rsquo;t quite found the girl he loves yet.
One girl he met at a bar with, was breaking it off with him after she met the guy she loves. He had never made a move or asked her out until that moment, and was upset that he had never made a move on her sooner. One gets the feeling that this guy would have regretted it either way, he would have ended up regretting asking her to be his gf (like the first scene). This was once commented on by some philosopher that every path in life comes with consequences that you will probably regret later. This feeling is called angst he said.</p>

<p>There was one scene at a party where he goes with his good friend Sarah, she gets rejected and he gets the number of some girl there with her boyfriend who had just left to get a drink. Sarah and him leave, he steals a wine, and they end up sleeping together, but she immediately says it was probably a mistake, they should be just friends. He doesn&rsquo;t say much, turns over and goes to bed.</p>

<p>But I think that the message is that it is easy to write a person off for X and Y, I mean sometimes a &lsquo;red flag&rsquo; (or those that we hear from media/influencers/podcasters) isn&rsquo;t always a red flag, you know? But people have their motives and reasons, and it is important to at least ask.</p>

<p>I dated someone who truly got that once - a really sweet and down to earth person named Rose. She had a colorful tattoo of her grandma (or was it a gypsie) on her shoulder and is like one of the funniest, bubbly people I have met. We had so many cool times like staying up late, kissing in the rain, running here or there, watching movies, went to parties and cooking. It didn&rsquo;t help that she thought I was cheating when in reality I was just SUCH a bad texter (she thought I accidentally texted her something a sweet message lol instead of someone else), sometimes went completely silent for HOURS because there was no service in the UT GDC&rsquo;s basement, and other moments like I didn&rsquo;t introduce her to my roommates since it was 3a.m and I was impatient at the time. But unfortunately I was the exact guy in the movie: young, inexperienced, not wanting to commit and just dumb.
The guy in this movie ofttent writes people off, gives up too quick, doesn&rsquo;t know how to express himself fully, and generally always sees grass greener wherever he isn&rsquo;t. I would say I am still two of those.</p>

<p>This movie forces you to put yourself in his shoes and ask what you would do? Are there differences between the girls? Where is he running? Is he running from something? What was the director trying to communicate?</p>
