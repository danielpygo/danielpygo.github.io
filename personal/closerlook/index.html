<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>As a soon-to-be new grad, I am currently preparing for interviews with Google and Microsoft so I want to dive deeper into Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook.</p>

<p>I read the go-to book on investing and the history of the stock market about three years ago and have identified myself as a risky investor . Nothing ventured nothing gained right? His advice is that the best you can ever do is to just throw your hands up in resignment and throw your money in an low-cost index fund; he&rsquo;s probably right but I like taking a risk and putting my money in companies I believe in</p>

<p>Hypothetically, If I had to put all my money into one company and hold it for 3 years who would I choose? A company&rsquo;s future matters a lot when choosing a job, so maybe it isn&rsquo;t that crazy of a hypothetical after all
</p></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="amazon">Amazon</h2>

<p>Ah Amazon. The company that got rich off of us lazy millenials who want anything within a day; I recently ordered a 48 pack of ferrero rocher&rsquo;s and my only second thought was that I wish Amazon did same-day shipping - oh wait they actually do that for food now hah. Amazon&rsquo;s revenue was 56.6 billion off of Amazon marketplace and 6.68 billion off AWS last quarter. Those numbers are truly astounding. The growth number on the sales is also incredible and they have penetrated so many markets by buying companies like twitch, goodreads, audible, EVEN real estate with whole foods, and numerous AI and smart-home related companies.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that Amazon is weak on AI/ML, great at business decision making, good at cloud, and bad in terms of culture. People say to avoid Amazon - micromanagement, not innovative anymore, bad hiring practices, bad retention rate, lots of politics, and much much more. It&rsquo;s gotten too big and the turnover rate is so horrible that its becoming less efficient.. Alexa has been kind of weak in my opinion, none of the &lsquo;skills&rsquo; are useful at all and calling an Uber using it always makes me distrustful. Besides that I guess it good for music? The smart home concept will be interesting, I&rsquo;m excited for that. But recently I believe there was a murder case in England where Amazon&rsquo;s echo device proved useful - so they are recording and using data&hellip; I do not have anything against working hard, but the overall sentiment at Amazon seems very negative and that&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>

<h2 id="google">Google</h2>

<p>Google is a great company and nobody can take that away from them. I like Larry Page a lot and I have grown fond of Go as well. Google is great at cloud/Kubernetes, great at AI/ML, and has high growth prospects. Google has been working towards smart cities, probably the farthest along in terms of self-driving cars, and has a very prestigious AI/ML team DeepMind . I am looking forward to Go 2 though.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy to get complacent at Google, and have been hearing that the teams are not as fast-paced and stressful as you might think. I wonder how much work is spent doing the intense algorithmic and AI work like the media portrays them, versus ordinary software engineering, api design and app development. From an outsiders perspective, I believe that YouTube is mismanaged and has made a lot of content creators upset. I would like to see them be more focused on the content creators, but this is a topic for another time. The other issue I see with working at Google is that there seem to have been a lot of very public political movements/protests there. In general, I like talking about politics, but am not really interested in political activism. Maybe this is overblown and isn&rsquo;t like this in person, but I don&rsquo;t like a tense work environment I like to be lighthearted. But I very much am passionate about coding and learning from others, so I still think I could learn a lot at google and contribute great code</p>

<h2 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h2>

<p>Next is Microsoft. Probably the most diverse company out of this list because there are so many exciting projects at Microsoft. Recently, it acquired Linkedin and Github, two incredibly impactful websites. I am very happy Microsoft acquired Github and think it is great news for Github since it now has more funds to take open-source to the next level. I actually own an Atom (IDE produced by github) shirt, because I love that IDE so much. It&rsquo;s incredible, one day out of college I want to make a useful Atom app just to give back. I check Github every day just to read code, see what is trending and stay current on things. I love that community and am happy Microsoft bought it before Amazon or Google did .</p>

<p>Microsoft, the company I actually adore the most out of this list. I have a good friend of ~10 years working there, Saad Najmi, and he loves it. Microsoft is doing great app development that affects so so many ordinary people.
Microsoft is great at cloud, great at research, great at app development and has good diversification of revenue streams. Google&rsquo;s revenue is still mostly advertising, Amazon&rsquo;s is their marketplace, but Microsoft has Windows(personal computing), Office, Azure, etc.</p>

<p>Excel is my personal favorite app from Microsoft&rsquo;s office suite and I one day want to become an expert at it (learn all the hotkeys &amp; features). It is a great, flexible tool for analysis of anything financial; I once saw an excel EXPERT do a stock analysis and prediction video for two hours, and it was mind-blowing how versatile the tool can be in the right hands. It&rsquo;s also used for science, investing, data science, data analysis, and in general is in a class of its own for usability and usefulness.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, I want to build things that are useful and interesting to me. Complex problems and writing quality code is what makes me happy; I have realized that the times when I am happiest are when I am learning and passionate about what I do and where I work for ..  Seldom do I hear complaints from Microsoft interns. When it comes to the company I dream to work for, at the moment it would be Microsoft. I like the company culture a lot there and personally know some great people that work there. They have managed to stay highly relevant in tech (a fast-changing field) for many years</p>
