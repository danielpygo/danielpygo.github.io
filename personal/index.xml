      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than a relationship on its last leg and that&amp;rsquo;s kind of where I have been for the last 3 months. It was miserable, but last night I felt like a weight was lifted off me and that I could finally breathe easy again. With so many rules, forbidden topics, and arguments/accusations, it was starting to feel like an adverserial game .
Like, we weren&amp;rsquo;t on the same team.</description>

      <title>Complexity: What Excites Me</title>

      <description>The Game Begat the Player
With any discipline, challenge, or complexity - a difficult game always excites the clever player who tries to bend the rules in his favor. It&amp;rsquo;s a cat and mouse game where people try to gain a competitive advantage over one and other . The ingenuinity and creativity of hackers, startups, poker players and of people in dating, politics and gaming, always impresses me. People push things forward for its own sake - it&amp;rsquo;s just fun.</description>

      <description>Intro As a soon-to-be new grad, I am currently preparing for interviews with Google and Microsoft so I want to dive deeper into Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
I read the go-to book on investing and the history of the stock market about three years ago and have identified myself as a risky investor . Nothing ventured nothing gained right? His advice is that the best you can ever do is to just throw your hands up in resignment and throw your money in an low-cost index fund; he&amp;rsquo;s probably right but I like taking a risk and putting my money in companies I believe in</description>

      <description>In 5 years I see myself working for a large tech company like Amazon/Google/Microsoft and building my skills to become an integral and useful developer. I have found that I get happiness when I see personal growth and by being ambitious/useful.
I plan on getting a few certificates and eventually doing an online masters program in the next 5 years. Building my github portfolio more is something I want to do more out of college.</description>

      <description>I watched a Vice documentary on an infamous character in American culture, and it was one of those moments where you realize you had been totally wrong about someone. The editing and narrative by Vice, was obviously trying to show a different perspective on this guy, and by the end of it the reporter seemed charmed with him and maaaybbeee had a crush on him as well
One of the top YouTube comments was &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like someone from twitch chat became a millionaire&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I just watched Exit Through The Gift Shop (2010) the other night and it has to be my favorite documentary. It&amp;rsquo;s about graffiti art and produced by Banksy. It&amp;rsquo;s a documentary started by a crazy but hilarious french cameraman, Thierry, but eventually finished by Banksy, the most famous and unmasked graffiti artist alive. Thierry, the cameraman, could never finish because he had collected thousands of hours of film over 8 years, with no real plan or storyline.</description>
