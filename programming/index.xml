      <description>Last night, for my neural networks class, we were told to make Tux (basically mario but a penguin) complete all the levels using a gradient free method. It was interesting because it was fine tuning a model that was able to get decently far into the level.  In my previous model I used convolutional neural network to feed into the features of a GRU Recurrent network. Then, without needing backprop, I trained 20 models using some small deviation on the parameters, and generated rewards for each of them.</description>
