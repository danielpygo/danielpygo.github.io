      <description>What I hope to get out of this blog, is a central store for my life, career and interests. Some may not care much about my career, so I intend to have other content on here as well. I have created two blogs in the past on wordpress, but they haven&amp;rsquo;t really given me what I wanted  Putting my thoughts and projects out there seems like a cool way to connect with people!</description>
