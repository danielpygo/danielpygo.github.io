<meta name="twitter:description" content="If small holes aren&rsquo;t fixed, then big holes will bring hardship.
It&rsquo;s better to walk thousands of miles than to read thousands of books.
Every step makes a footprint.
Today&rsquo;s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. - Nikola Tesla
With ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look - for dizzier heights."/>

    <p><em>If small holes aren&rsquo;t fixed, then big holes will bring hardship.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s better to walk thousands of miles than to read thousands of books.</em></p>

<p><em>Every step makes a footprint.</em></p>

<p><em>Today&rsquo;s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality.</em> - Nikola Tesla</p>

<p><em>With ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look - for dizzier heights.</em> - Nikola Tesla</p>

<p><em>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success&hellip; such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.</em> -Nikola Tesla</p>

<p><em>“My own opinion is enough for me, and I claim the right to have it defended against any consensus, any majority, anywhere, any place, any time. And anyone who disagrees with this can pick a number, get in line, and kiss my ass.</em> - Christopher Hitchens</p>

<p><em>Time spent arguing is, oddly enough, almost never wasted.</em> - Christopher Hitchens</p>

<p><em>“Just be true to yourself, and listen as much as one is able to to other people whose opinions you respect and look up to but in the end it has to come from you. You can’t really worry too much by looking to the left and the right about what the competition is doing or what other people in your field are doing. It has to be a true vision.”</em> - Anna Wintour</p>

<p><em>All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.</em> - Schopenhauer</p>

<p><em>The worst mistake that you can make is to think you&rsquo;re alive when you&rsquo;re really alive in life&rsquo;s waiting room</em> - Waking Life</p>

<p><em>We have got to realize that we&rsquo;re being conditioned on a mass scale. Start challenging this corporate slave state.</em> - Waking Life</p>

<p><em>I haven&rsquo;t seen too many around lately. Things have been tough lately for dreamers. They say dreaming is dead, no one does it anymore. It&rsquo;s not dead it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s been forgotten, removed from our language. Nobody teaches it so nobody knows it exists. The dreamer is banished to obscurity. Well, I&rsquo;m trying to change all that, and I hope you are too. By dreaming, every day. Dreaming with our hands and dreaming with our minds. Our planet is facing the greatest problems it&rsquo;s ever faced, ever. So whatever you do, don&rsquo;t be bored, this is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped to be alive. And things are just starting</em> - Waking Life</p>
