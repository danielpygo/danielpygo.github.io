      <description>I just watched Exit Through The Gift Shop (2010) the other night and it has to be my favorite documentary. It&#39;s about graffiti art and produced by Banksy. It&#39;s a documentary started by a crazy but hilarious french graffiti cameraman Thierry, but eventually finished by Banksy, the most famous and unmasked graffiti artist alive. Thierry, the cameraman, could never finish because he had collected thousands of hours of film over 8 years, with no real plan or storyline.</description>
