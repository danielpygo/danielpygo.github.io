      <description>Currently, I am a student at The University of Texas at Austin and am majoring in Computer Science. My expertise is in Cloud Computing and Software Engineering (Applications/Backend). I am excellent at C++, Java and Go. I have done a lot of coding in Python as well for artificial intelligence related courses  Other interests include food, cooking, writing, podcasts and extreme ferret racing! One thing I want to do before I die is travel to Italy or spend a day with Karl Pilkington.</description>

      <description>In 5 years I see myself working for a large tech company like Amazon/Google/Microsoft and building my skills to become an integral and useful developer. I have found that I get happiness when I see personal growth and by being ambitious/useful.  I plan on getting a few certificates and eventually doing an online masters program in the next 5 years. Building my github portfolio more is something I want to do more out of college.</description>

      <title>The Game</title>

      <description>The Game Begat the Player  With any discipline, challenge, or complexity - a difficult game always excites the clever player who tries to bend the rules in his favor. A cat and mouse game where humans try to gain a competitive advantage over one and other. The ingenuinity and creativity of hackers, startups, poker players and of people in dating, politics and gaming, never ceases to excite me. People push things forward for its own sake - it&#39;s just fun - there is no system or paradigm that isn&#39;t constantly shifting.</description>

      <description>I am applying for both right now! If I get the internship I want, I would take another semester to finish my minor after it in December 2019 (Since internships require a semester after it ends). As of right now, I am set to graduate in May 2019.   Download pdf!</description>

      <title>Hashing</title>

      <description>Cmu hashing notes
Separate Chaining The idea is to maintain an array of linked lists. All keys that hash to the same loc are just added to the linked list. Could maybe optimize these linked lists by having an lru cache implemntation or another data structure .. Cost of these operations is related to the average len of a chain. Disadvantage - costly allocation, and memory for the pointers.. O(n) worst case.</description>

      <description>I just watched Exit Through The Gift Shop (2010) the other night and it has to be my favorite documentary. It&#39;s about graffiti art and produced by Banksy. It&#39;s a documentary started by a crazy but hilarious french graffiti cameraman Thierry, but eventually finished by Banksy, the most famous and unmasked graffiti artist alive. Thierry, the cameraman, could never finish because he had collected thousands of hours of film over 8 years, with no real plan or storyline.</description>

      <description>Hi! I am Daniel Moore and this is my blog! I have created two blogs in the past where I talked about technology in one and political theory in the other. This is a place where I will place my thoughts, notes and anything I find interesting! I am a software engineer attending UT Austin, and am good at systems, web applications, and cloud computing. I have taken 9 hours of machine learning coursework at UT Austin, but my passion lies in programming and creating things that are useful!</description>
